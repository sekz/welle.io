# DAB Announcement Switching Logic - Standard Compliance Checklist

**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Standard:** ETSI EN 300 401 V2.1.1 Section 8.1.6.2
**Status:**  FIXED (as of commit 5e8c7b59)

## ETSI EN 300 401 Switching Requirements

### FIG 0/18: Announcement Support (ASu)

Provides TWO pieces of information per service:

1. **ASu flags (16 bits):** Announcement types this service can **PRODUCE**
   - Bit 0 = Alarm
   - Bit 1 = Road Traffic
   - Bit 2 = Transport Flash
   - ... (11 types total)

2. **Cluster IDs (list):** Announcement clusters this service **PARTICIPATES IN**
   - A service can receive announcements from clusters even if ASu = 0x0000
   - A service can participate in multiple clusters (local, regional, national)

**Example:**
```
Service 0xC221 (Music station):
  ASu flags: 0x0000 (produces NO announcements)
  Cluster IDs: [1, 5] (receives announcements from clusters 1 and 5)
```

### FIG 0/19: Announcement Switching (ASw)

Indicates **active announcements** in a specific cluster:

```
Cluster ID: 1
ASw flags: 0x0001 (Alarm active)
Subchannel ID: 18 (where to find the announcement audio)
```

**State Transitions:**
- `ASw = 0x0000` ’ `ASw ` 0x0000`: **ANNOUNCEMENT STARTED**
- `ASw ` 0x0000` ’ `ASw = 0x0000`: **ANNOUNCEMENT ENDED**
- `ASw ` 0x0000` ’ different value: **ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE CHANGED**

---

## Switching Decision Logic (6 Criteria)

Per ETSI EN 300 401 Section 8.1.6.2.1, the receiver **SHOULD** switch to an announcement if:

###  Criterion 1: Feature Enabled
```cpp
if (!user_prefs_.enabled) {
    return false;
}
```
**User preference:** "Enable announcement switching"

---

###  Criterion 2: Priority Check (if already in announcement)
```cpp
if (state_ == AnnouncementState::PlayingAnnouncement) {
    auto current_priority = getAnnouncementPriority(current_announcement_.getHighestPriorityType());
    auto new_priority = getAnnouncementPriority(ann.getHighestPriorityType());
    return new_priority < current_priority;  // Lower number = higher priority
}
```
**Rule:** Only interrupt current announcement if new one has **higher priority**

---

###  Criterion 3: Announcement Type Enabled
```cpp
AnnouncementType type = ann.getHighestPriorityType();
if (!isAnnouncementTypeEnabled(type)) {
    return false;
}
```
**User preference:** User can disable specific announcement types (e.g., disable News/Weather)

---

###  Criterion 4: Priority Threshold
```cpp
int priority = getAnnouncementPriority(type);
if (priority > user_prefs_.priority_threshold) {
    return false;  // Priority too low
}
```
**User preference:** "Only switch for announcements with priority d N" (1-11)

**Example:**
- Threshold = 4: Only Alarm, RoadTraffic, TransportFlash, Warning will interrupt
- News (priority 5) and lower will NOT interrupt

---

### L Criterion 5: **CLUSTER PARTICIPATION** (NOT ASu flags!)

**L WRONG LOGIC (from original plan):**
```cpp
// Check 5: Service supports this announcement type?
auto support = getServiceSupport(original_service_id_);
if (!support.support_flags.supports(type)) {  // L Checks ASu flags!
    return false;
}
```
**Problem:** This checks if service can **PRODUCE** the announcement type, but services can **RECEIVE** announcements without producing them!

** CORRECT LOGIC (fixed in commit 5e8c7b59):**
```cpp
// Check 5: Service participates in announcement cluster?
auto support = getServiceSupport(original_service_id_);
bool participates_in_cluster = std::find(
    support.cluster_ids.begin(),
    support.cluster_ids.end(),
    ann.cluster_id
) != support.cluster_ids.end();

if (!participates_in_cluster) {
    return false;
}
```
**Rule:** Switch only if current service **participates in the announcement's cluster**

---

###  Criterion 6: Announcement is Active
```cpp
if (!ann.isActive()) {  // Checks ann.active_flags != 0x0000
    return false;
}
```
**Rule:** Only switch if announcement is actually active (ASw ` 0x0000)

---

## Complete Switching Algorithm

```cpp
bool AnnouncementManager::shouldSwitchToAnnouncement(const ActiveAnnouncement& ann) const {
    // 1. Feature enabled?
    if (!user_prefs_.enabled) {
        return false;
    }

    // 2. Already in announcement? Check priority
    if (state_ == AnnouncementState::PlayingAnnouncement) {
        auto current_priority = getAnnouncementPriority(
            current_announcement_.getHighestPriorityType());
        auto new_priority = getAnnouncementPriority(
            ann.getHighestPriorityType());
        return new_priority < current_priority;  // Lower = higher priority
    }

    // 3. Announcement type enabled?
    AnnouncementType type = ann.getHighestPriorityType();
    if (!isAnnouncementTypeEnabled(type)) {
        return false;
    }

    // 4. Priority threshold?
    int priority = getAnnouncementPriority(type);
    if (priority > user_prefs_.priority_threshold) {
        return false;
    }

    // 5.  FIXED: Service participates in cluster? (NOT checks ASu flags!)
    if (original_service_id_ != 0) {
        auto it = service_support_.find(original_service_id_);
        if (it != service_support_.end()) {
            bool participates_in_cluster = std::find(
                it->second.cluster_ids.begin(),
                it->second.cluster_ids.end(),
                ann.cluster_id
            ) != it->second.cluster_ids.end();

            if (!participates_in_cluster) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }

    // 6. Announcement is active?
    if (!ann.isActive()) {
        return false;
    }

    // All checks passed - SWITCH!
    return true;
}
```

## Special Rules for Alarm Announcements

Per ETSI EN 300 401 Section 8.1.6.2.1:

> "The receiver **MUST** interrupt current service and switch to alarm announcement channel immediately."

**Implementation:**
- Alarm has **highest priority** (Priority 1)
- Cannot be disabled by user (always enabled)
- Cannot be blocked by priority threshold (unless threshold = 0)
- MUST switch even if service ASu = 0x0000 (as long as service is in cluster)

**User Impact:**
- Alarm announcements interrupt music/talk shows
- No way to disable (emergency safety requirement)
- Automatic return to original service when alarm ends

---

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Music Service Receives Alarm

**Current Service:** 0xC221 (Music station)
- ASu flags: `0x0000` (produces NO announcements)
- Cluster IDs: `[1]` (participates in cluster 1)

**FIG 0/19 Received:**
- Cluster: `1`
- ASw: `0x0001` (Alarm active)
- Subchannel: `18`

**Switching Decision:**
1.  Feature enabled
2.  Not already in announcement
3.  Alarm is enabled (always)
4.  Alarm priority = 1 (passes any threshold)
5.  **Service 0xC221 participates in cluster 1** (cluster_ids contains 1)
6.  Announcement is active (ASw = 0x0001)

**Result:**  **SWITCH to subchannel 18**

**Audio Flow:**
```
t=0s:  Playing 0xC221 music
t=1s:  FIG 0/19 received
t=1.1s: Audio switches to subchannel 18 (alarm sound)
t=15s: FIG 0/19 ASw = 0x0000 (alarm ends)
t=15.1s: Audio switches back to 0xC221 (music resumes)
```

---

### Scenario 2: Service Not in Cluster

**Current Service:** 0xD302 (Regional station)
- ASu flags: `0x0004` (produces Transport announcements)
- Cluster IDs: `[5]` (participates in cluster 5 only)

**FIG 0/19 Received:**
- Cluster: `1` (different cluster!)
- ASw: `0x0001` (Alarm active)
- Subchannel: `18`

**Switching Decision:**
1.  Feature enabled
2.  Not already in announcement
3.  Alarm is enabled
4.  Alarm priority = 1
5. L **Service 0xD302 does NOT participate in cluster 1** (only in cluster 5)
6. (not checked)

**Result:** L **DO NOT SWITCH**

**Reason:** Service is in wrong cluster (regional vs national)

---

### Scenario 3: News Announcement (User Disabled)

**Current Service:** 0xC221
- Cluster IDs: `[1]`

**FIG 0/19 Received:**
- Cluster: `1`
- ASw: `0x0010` (News active)
- Subchannel: `20`

**User Settings:**
- News announcements: **DISABLED**

**Switching Decision:**
1.  Feature enabled
2.  Not already in announcement
3. L **News type is disabled by user**
4. (not checked)

**Result:** L **DO NOT SWITCH**

**Reason:** User preference - doesn't want news interruptions
