## Detailed Scenario Descriptions

### 1. AnnouncementSupportFlags Operations

**Test Cases:**
- Initially empty (flags = 0x0000)
- Set single flag (Alarm → 0x0001)
- Set multiple flags (Alarm + Traffic → 0x0003)
- Clear flag operation
- Get active types in priority order

**Validation:**
```cpp
AnnouncementSupportFlags flags;
flags.set(AnnouncementType::Alarm);
flags.set(AnnouncementType::RoadTraffic);
// flags.flags should be 0x0003
// flags.supports(Alarm) should be true
```

**ETSI Reference:** Section 8.1.6 (ASu/ASw flags)

---

### 2. End-to-End Announcement Flow

**Scenario:** Complete announcement lifecycle from FIG reception to return

**Steps:**
1. User listens to Service 0x4001, Subchannel 5
2. FIG 0/18 received: Service supports Alarm + Traffic
3. FIG 0/19 received: Alarm announcement active, Subchannel 18
4. Manager evaluates: Should switch? → YES
5. Switch to announcement: State → SwitchingToAnnouncement
6. Confirm playback: State → PlayingAnnouncement
7. FIG 0/19 received: ASw = 0x0000 (announcement ended)
8. Auto-return: State → Idle, restore Subchannel 5

**Expected Results:**
- Seamless switching without audio dropout
- Original service context preserved
- All state transitions correct
- Duration tracking accurate

**ETSI Reference:** Section 8.1.6 (complete flow)

---

### 3. Manual Return During Announcement

**Scenario:** User cancels announcement before it ends

**Preconditions:**
- allow_manual_return = true
- In PlayingAnnouncement state

**Steps:**
1. Traffic announcement active, playing on Subchannel 18
2. User presses "Return to Service" button
3. Manager.returnToOriginalService() called
4. State transitions: PlayingAnnouncement → Idle
5. Restore original service immediately

**Expected Results:**
- Immediate return (no waiting for ASw = 0x0000)
- State = Idle
- Original service playing

**Edge Cases Tested:**
- Manual return before confirmation
- Manual return when allow_manual_return = false

---

### 4. Announcement Timeout Enforcement

**Scenario:** Long-running announcement exceeds max duration

**Configuration:**
- max_announcement_duration = 5 seconds (for testing)

**Steps:**
1. News announcement starts
2. Announcement continues for 6 seconds
3. FIG 0/19 update received (triggers timeout check)
4. Manager detects timeout exceeded
5. Auto-return to original service

**Expected Results:**
- Timeout triggers at 5 seconds
- Auto-return activated
- State = Idle
- History entry created

**Safety Purpose:** Prevents being stuck in announcement if broadcaster fails to send ASw = 0x0000

---

### 5. Priority-Based Switching

**Scenario:** Higher priority announcement preempts lower

**Test Case A: Higher Priority Preemption**
1. Traffic announcement active (Priority 2)
2. Alarm announcement arrives (Priority 1)
3. Should switch? → YES
4. Switch to Alarm (higher priority)

**Test Case B: Lower Priority Rejection**
1. Alarm announcement active (Priority 1)
2. News announcement arrives (Priority 5)
3. Should switch? → NO
4. Remain in Alarm

**Priority Order (ETSI Table 14):**
```
1. Alarm (highest)
2. Road Traffic
3. Transport Flash
4. Warning/Service
5. News Flash
6. Area Weather
7. Event
8. Special Event
9. Programme Information
10. Sport Report
11. Financial Report (lowest)
```

**ETSI Reference:** Section 8.1.6.1 (Priority handling)

---

### 6. User Preference Filtering

**Scenario A: Disabled Announcement Type**
```cpp
AnnouncementPreferences prefs;
prefs.type_enabled[AnnouncementType::Traffic] = false;
manager.setUserPreferences(prefs);

// Traffic announcement arrives
// Should NOT switch (type disabled by user)
```

**Scenario B: Priority Threshold**
```cpp
prefs.priority_threshold = 3; // Only Alarm, Traffic, Transport
// News (priority 5) should NOT trigger switch
// Alarm (priority 1) should trigger switch
```

**Scenario C: Feature Disabled**
```cpp
prefs.enabled = false;
// NO announcements should trigger, even Alarm
```

---

### 7. Multi-Cluster Announcements

**Scenario:** Service participates in multiple clusters

**Configuration:**
- Service 0x4001 in clusters {1, 2, 3}
- Cluster 1: Alarm announcement
- Cluster 2: Traffic announcement
- Cluster 3: Weather announcement

**Expected Behavior:**
- Track all 3 announcements separately
- Switch to highest priority (Alarm)
- Can switch between clusters based on priority

**ETSI Reference:** Section 6.3.5 (Cluster ID field)

---

### 8. Thread Safety Validation

**Test A: Concurrent Preference Updates**
- 10 threads × 100 iterations
- Each thread updates preferences
- Verify: No crashes, no data corruption

**Test B: Concurrent State Queries**
- While in PlayingAnnouncement state
- 10 threads × 100 iterations querying state
- Verify: All queries return consistent data

**Synchronization:**
- All operations protected by std::mutex
- Lock-free reads not used (safety over performance)

---

### 9. Performance Benchmarks

**Benchmark A: Switching Decision**
```
Test: shouldSwitchToAnnouncement() × 10,000
Target: < 1 microsecond average
Typical: 0.5 microseconds
```

**Benchmark B: State Transition Cycle**
```
Test: switch → confirm → return × 1,000
Target: < 100 microseconds average
Typical: 50 microseconds
```

**Benchmark C: Flags Operations**
```
Test: set/supports/getActiveTypes × 100,000
Target: < 0.1 microseconds average
Typical: 0.05 microseconds
```

---

### 10. Edge Cases

**Case 1: Empty Announcement**
```cpp
ActiveAnnouncement ann;
ann.active_flags.flags = 0x0000; // No active types
// Should NOT switch (isActive() returns false)
```

**Case 2: Announcement Without Service Support**
```cpp
// No FIG 0/18 received for current service
// Alarm announcement arrives
// Behavior: May or may not switch (policy decision)
```

**Case 3: Return Without Being In Announcement**
```cpp
// State = Idle
manager.returnToOriginalService();
// Should handle gracefully, remain in Idle
```

**Case 4: Multiple Active Types**
```cpp
ann.active_flags.set(Alarm);
ann.active_flags.set(Traffic);
ann.active_flags.set(Weather);
// getHighestPriorityType() should return Alarm
```

---

### 11. ETSI Compliance Validation

**Test A: FIG 0/18 ASu Interpretation**
```cpp
ServiceAnnouncementSupport support;
support.support_flags.flags = 0x0023;
// Binary: 0000 0000 0010 0011
// Bit 0: Alarm ✓
// Bit 1: Traffic ✓
// Bit 5: Weather ✓
```

**Test B: FIG 0/19 ASw Interpretation**
```cpp
ActiveAnnouncement ann;
ann.active_flags.flags = 0x0001;
// Only Alarm active (bit 0 set)
```

**Test C: Priority Order (Table 14)**
```cpp
REQUIRE(getAnnouncementPriority(Alarm) == 1);
REQUIRE(getAnnouncementPriority(Traffic) == 2);
// ... validate all 11 types
```

**Test D: Announcement End Signaling**
```cpp
// ASw = 0x0000 signals end
ann.active_flags.flags = 0x0000;
REQUIRE(ann.isActive() == false);
// Manager should auto-return to original service
```

---

## State Machine Validation

### All Valid State Transitions

```
Idle → AnnouncementDetected
  Trigger: FIG 0/19 with ASw != 0x0000, meets preferences

AnnouncementDetected → SwitchingToAnnouncement
  Trigger: switchToAnnouncement() called

SwitchingToAnnouncement → PlayingAnnouncement
  Trigger: confirmAnnouncementStarted() called

PlayingAnnouncement → AnnouncementEnding
  Trigger: returnToOriginalService() or ASw = 0x0000 or timeout

AnnouncementEnding → RestoringOriginalService
  Trigger: Automatic progression

RestoringOriginalService → Idle
  Trigger: Automatic progression
```

### Invalid Transitions (Should Not Occur)

- Idle → PlayingAnnouncement (must go through Switching)
- PlayingAnnouncement → SwitchingToAnnouncement (no backward)
- AnnouncementEnding → AnnouncementDetected (no loop)
